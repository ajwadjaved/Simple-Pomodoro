Very basic Pomodoro timer program I experimented with to learn about tkinter, later will push an update here to learn more about creating a polished application with Python/Qt.
Change extension to .pyw if you want to run this in the background.

For i3blocks-pomodoro, click on Raw and copy the code and then paste it in your i3blocks config file. LMB to pause and RMB to reset.
